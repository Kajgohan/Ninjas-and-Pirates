This is our readme file for project 3. The project overall went pretty well for us. We had a lot of issues writing a flawless scheme for part 1, but we figured it early enough so that it wouldn't inhibit our progress. For part 2, we had some trouble enforcing fairness, but our solution worked out ok. For more details read the explanation files. in order to run these programs, run the command 'make' whil in the directory. For part 1, run './part1 x x x x x x x', where the x's represent the number of workers, number of pirates, number of ninjas, average costume time for pirates, average costume time for ninjas, average arrival time for pirates, and average arrival time for ninjas (respectively). For part 2, run './part2'. This will begin the traffic intersection. We believe that our project covered most of the included requirements, if not all.


Thank you!
